# Changelog

## [2.1.0]
- Added an optional `responsive` prop to the `Image` component. Set `responsive` to `false` to disable automatic `srcset` generation. You can also use this when the **Restricted Unnamed Transformation** setting is enabled and you want to prevent the SDK from applying any transformations to the image URL beyond those you explicitly specify.
