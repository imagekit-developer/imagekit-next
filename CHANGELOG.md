# Changelog

## 2.1.3

- Fixed missing `ref` prop support in the **Image** component. The component now properly accepts and forwards all Next.js Image props, including `ref`, by using `React.ComponentPropsWithRef<typeof NextImage>` instead of the exported `ImageProps` type.

## 2.1.2

- Bump `@imagekitio/javascript` dependency to `5.1.0`.
- Export `getResponsiveImageAttributes` util function from the package.
- Improved type definitions for the solid color overlay transformations.

## 2.1.1

- `transformationPosition` prop in the **Video** component was not working, this has been fixed.

## 2.1.0

- Added an optional `responsive` prop to the **`Image`** component. Set `responsive` to `false` to disable automatic `srcset` generation and prevent any transformations you havenâ€™t explicitly specified. This is also handy when Restricted Unnamed Transformation is enabled and you want to stop the SDK from applying any extra transformations beyond the ones you specify.

## 2.0.0

- Major v2 upgrade with several breaking changes and wide-ranging improvements.
- See the updated [official documentation](https://imagekit.io/docs/integration/nextjs) before upgrading.

## 1.0.1
- Added Node-version support.  
- Improved lazy-loading behaviour.

## 1.0.0
- Initial stable release.
